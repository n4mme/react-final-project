StayEasy - Example Airbnb-like React App (starter)

How to use:
1. Unzip this project (airbnb-react.zip).
2. In the project folder run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the dev server.

Notes:
- This starter focuses on UI, structure and checklist placeholders (host/guest/admin pages, account settings, listing cards, image placeholders, filters).
- Replace `public/images/sample-property.jpg` with your real property images.
- This is intended to be used with `create-react-app` or as a replacement src/public for one.
